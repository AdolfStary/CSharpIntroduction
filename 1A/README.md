Requirements:
Write a program that prompts the user for a number (as an int) and outputs the cube of that number (raised to the third power).


Encountered bugs:
Used method Convert.ToInt32(Console.Read()), which was giving a wrong number, Console.Read() reads the following character in ANSCII. I used Console.ReadLine() to fix the bug.
