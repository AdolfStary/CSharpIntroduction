Requirements:
Write a program that will take in a total dollar value (as a double) and a number of diners (as an int) and calculate the amount of the bill that each diner should pay (equal split).

Encountered bugs:
The program would do the exact opposite while testing for right input, I forgot to put ! before TryParse.
